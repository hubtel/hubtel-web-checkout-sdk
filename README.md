# External Unified Checkout SDK Integration Documentation

## Overview
The Checkout SDK provide seamless way for businesses to accept payment from their customers. The SDK offers three primary methods of integration: Redirect, Iframe, and Modal. This provides flexibility for developers to choose the integration method that best suits their needs.


## Installation

To use the Hubtel Checkout SDK to collect payment, install the NPM Package or include the the CDN link in your HTML file:


```bash
npm install hubtel-checkout
```

## Methods of Integration
The Hubtel Checkout SDK supports three primary methods of integration:

**1. Modal Integration:** This method opens the checkout page in a modal popup

**2. Redirect Integration:**  This method opens the checkout page in a new tab or window. 

**3. Iframe Integration:** This method embeds the checkout page within an iframe on your webpage.




**Note**: Before calling the Checkout SDK, most internal apps would call a Pre-Checkout API provided by their backend team. The implementation might differ.

Sample Pre-checkout Request:

```json
{
  "amount": "1",
  "phoneNumber": "0200000000"
}
```

Sample Pre-checkout Response:

```json
{
  "message": "success",
  "code": "200",
  "data": {
    "description": "Payment of GHS 1.00 for (18013782) (MR SOMUAH STA ADANE-233557913587) ",
    "clientReference": "f03dbdcf8d4040dd88d0a82794b0229f",
    "amount": 1.0,
    "customerMobileNumber": "233557913587",
    "callbackUrl": "https://instantservicesproxy.hubtel.com/v2.1/checkout/callback"
  }
}
```

The response from the Pre-Checkout API usually contains all information needed for a successful checkout. Once retrieved the data is then passed onto the Hubtel Checkout SDK to begin the checkout.

**Note**: The above approach may not be applicable in your case.


## Modal Integration

The modal integration method opens the checkout page in a modal popup. This is done by calling the `openModal` method of the Checkout SDK instance and passing the purchase information, configuration options and callBacks for event handling as parameters.


#### Example Usage

```javascript

// Import the Checkout SDK
import CheckoutSdk from "hubtel-checkout";

// Initialize the Checkout SDK
const checkout = new CheckoutSdk();

// Call the initPay function to open the modal
const initPay = () => {
    const purchaseInfo = {
      amount: 50,
      purchaseDescription: 'Payment of GHS 1.00 for (18013782) (MR SOMUAH STA ADANE-233557913587)',
      customerPhoneNumber: "233557913587",
      clientReference: "unique-client-reference-12345",
    };

    const config = {
      branding: "enabled",
      callbackUrl: "https://yourcallbackurl.com",
      merchantAccount: 11334,
      basicAuth: "your-basic-auth-here",
    };

    checkout.openModal({
      purchaseInfo,
      config,
      callBacks: {
        onInit: () => console.log("Iframe initialized: "),
        onPaymentSuccess: (data) => {console.log("Payment succeeded: ", data)
          // You can close the popup here
          checkout.closePopUp();
        },
        onPaymentFailure: (data) => console.log("Payment failed: ", data),
        onLoad: () => console.log("Checkout has been loaded: "),
        onFeesChanged: (fees) => console.log("Payment channel has changed: ", fees),
        onResize: (size) => console.log("Iframe has been resized: ", size?.height),
        onClose: (size) => console.log("The modal has closed ", size?.height),
      },
    });
}
```

## Redirect Integration

The redirect method opens the checkout page in a new tab or window. This is done by calling the `redirect` method of the Checkout SDK instance and passing the purchase information and configuration options as parameters.


#### Example Usage

```javascript

// Import the Checkout SDK
import CheckoutSdk from "hubtel-checkout";

// Initialize the Checkout SDK
const checkout = new CheckoutSdk();



const redirect = () =>{

const purchaseInfo = {
      amount: 50,
      purchaseDescription: 'Payment of GHS 1.00 for (18013782) (MR SOMUAH STA ADANE-233557913587)',
      customerPhoneNumber: "233557913587",
      clientReference: "unique-client-reference-12345",
    };

    const config = {
      branding: "enabled",
      callbackUrl: "https://yourcallbackurl.com",
      merchantAccount: 11334,
      basicAuth: "your-basic-auth-here",
    };

 checkout.redirect({
      purchaseInfo,
      config
    });
}
```
